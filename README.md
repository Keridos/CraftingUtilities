Utility Recipes
========


Utility Recipes is a mod that adds several Utility Recipes to Minecraft.  
Examples are uncrafting recipes for bricks, stairs and several crafting recipes for different things.
It also adds in an Autocrafter that will craft the recipe you set in the top crafting table from the items in the bottom on every redstone pulse.
