Crafting Utilities is a mod that adds several Utility Recipes to Minecraft and some mods.
Examples are uncrafting recipes for bricks, stairs and several crafting recipes for different things.
Since v0.3.0 it also adds Recipes for Mod Facades and Forge Multipart Blocks aswell for their respective Decorative Blocks. Also added in is an Autocrafter that will craft the recipe you set in the top crafting table from the items in the bottom on every redstone pulse.  
Every Feature in this Mod is disable-able in the config file.
